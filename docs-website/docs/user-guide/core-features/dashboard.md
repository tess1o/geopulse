# The Dashboard

The GeoPulse Dashboard provides a high-level, visual overview of your movement patterns and location history. It's designed to give you quick insights into your activity at a glance, summarizing data into easily digestible cards and charts.

The dashboard is organized into columns that allow you to compare your activity across different time frames:

*   **Selected Period:** Shows data for the date range you've chosen in the main date picker at the top of the application.
*   **7 Days Overview:** A summary of your activity over the last 7 days.
*   **30 Days Overview:** A summary of your activity over the last 30 days.

Each time period has its own set of cards, which are explained below.
