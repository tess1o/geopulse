# Favorite Locations

Favorite Locations let you assign custom names to specific places on your **Timeline Map**.  
They help you keep your Timeline organized and meaningful by replacing automatic reverse geocoding results with names you choose.

There are two types of favorites:

### Favorite Point

A single location on the map. All GPS points within **75 meters** of this point will use the custom name you assign.  
Use this to label frequently visited places like **Home**, **Office**, or **Gym**.

Favorite Points always **override reverse geocoding results** when building your Timeline.

### Favorite Area

A rectangular zone you draw on the map. All GPS points **inside that rectangle**, and within **15 meters outside its border**, will use the same custom name.  
Use this for larger areas such as **parks**, **malls**, or **city squares**.

Favorite Areas also **take priority** over reverse geocoding results.
