GeoPulse transforms raw GPS data from tracking apps like OwnTracks, Overland, Dawarich or HomeAsssitant into organized
timelines and
insights. It automatically categorizes your location data into stays and trips, providing a clear view of your movement
patterns while keeping everything on your own server. GeoPulse has integration with Immich server so you can view your
photos directly on the timeline map.
